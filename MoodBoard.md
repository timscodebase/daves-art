# Project Kickoff: Artist Website Mood Board

Hello! This document is our starting point for defining the look, feel, and function of your new website. Your initial thought to "imitate other successful artist websites" is smartâ€”it shows you want a site that is effective and professional.

Our goal is to figure out *what kind* of success you want and build a site that is uniquely yours.

### Part 1: What is the Goal?

Before we talk about design, let's define what you want the website to *do*. Please pick your #1 priority:

-   [ ] **Showcase my work:** A beautiful, high-end portfolio is the main goal.
-   [ ] **Sell my work:** E-commerce functionality is the most important feature.
-   [ ] **Build my brand:** I want people to understand me and my process.
-   [ ] **Act as a CV/Archive:** I need a comprehensive record of my work for curators, galleries, and researchers.
-   [ ] **Announce news:** The primary goal is to share updates about exhibitions, press, and events.

### Part 2: Four Potential Directions

Here are four distinct "moods" or concepts for your website. Which one resonates most with you and your art?

#### Direction A: The Digital White Gallery
* **The Idea:** Clean, quiet, and focused. We treat the screen like a gallery wall. The design is minimal so the art can be the hero.
* **Key Feelings:** Premium, elegant, calm, focused, timeless.
* **Inspiration:**
    * Random International: [https://www.random-international.com/](https://www.random-international.com/)
    * (Many fine art photographers follow this model)

#### Direction B: The Immersive Experience
* **The Idea:** We use video, animation, and bold layouts to create a dynamic and memorable experience that pulls the visitor in.
* **Key Feelings:** Modern, engaging, cinematic, impressive.
* **Inspiration:**
    * Es Devlin: [https://esdevlin.com/](https://esdevlin.com/)
    * (Think of websites where the loading screen or homepage is a full-screen video)

#### Direction C: The Artist's Journal
* **The Idea:** This feels more personal. We mix finished work with behind-the-scenes content like sketches, studio photos, and short stories about your process.
* **Key Feelings:** Authentic, personal, narrative, intimate.
* **Inspiration:**
    * Shantell Martin: [https://shantellmartin.art/](https://shantellmartin.art/)
    * (Think of a high-end online magazine or journal)

#### Direction D: The Organized Archive
* **The Idea:** For artists with a large, diverse body of work. The design is built around organization and searchability, allowing users to filter projects by year, medium, or series.
* **Key Feelings:** Comprehensive, academic, functional, structured.
* **Inspiration:**
    * Jonas Lund: [https://jonaslund.com/](https://jonaslund.com/)
    * Tom Sachs: [https://www.tomsachs.org/](https://www.tomsachs.org/)

### Part 3: Next Steps

1.  Please review the four directions above.
2.  Choose **one primary direction** that feels right for you. It's okay to like elements from others, but picking a primary focus is key.
3.  Let's schedule a brief call to discuss your choice. We will use it as the foundation for the entire project.
